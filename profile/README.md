# 🎯 ChicCheck - Smart Self Attendance Check With Liveness Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
**ChicCheck** is an AI-powered attendance system that ensures secure and effortless attendance tracking. Using **liveness detection**, it prevents fake check-ins via photos, videos, or masks. This system operates in **real-time**, verifying identities instantly and **eliminating manual roll calls**. It maintains **detailed timestamped records**, making attendance **simple, fast, and reliable**.  

## 🚀 Key Benefits  
✅ **Saves Time** – No manual roll calls, allowing instructors to focus on teaching.  
🔐 **Prevents Cheating** – AI-powered **liveness detection** ensures only real students check in.  
📱 **Easy to Use** – Students can check in using their own devices seamlessly.  
📑 **Paperless** – Digital records replace traditional paper-based tracking.  
📊 **Accurate & Efficient** – Reduces human errors and integrates directly into databases.  

## 🏗️ Repository Structure
